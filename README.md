### Predicting named entities of GMB(Groningen Meaning Bank) corpus


Entity tags are encoded using a BIO annotation scheme, where each entity label is prefixed with either B or I letter. B- denotes the beginning and I- inside of an entity. The prefixes are used to detect multiword entities, e.g. sentence:"World War II", tags:(B-eve, I-eve, I-eve). All other words, which donâ€™t refer to entities of interest, are labeled with the O tag.

Tag | Label meaning | Example Given
--- | ------------- | -------------
geo | Geographical Entity | London
org | Organization | ONU
per | Person | Bush
gpe | Geopolitical Entity | British
tim | Time indicator | Wednesday
art | Artifact | Chrysler
eve | Event | Christmas
nat | Natural Phenomenon | Hurricane
